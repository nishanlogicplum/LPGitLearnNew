# Just Structure of entire Project
1. Show me the structure of Site Hawk

# Answering PM's and Developers Queries
2. Explain what is the folder Account Comparison Process All about? Give me the purpose and flow of each modules inside that folder. Be as descriptive as possible.
3. Inside ScoutCompedatitiveScore.py, is the final practice score scaled? If yes, what type of scaling is done?
4. Give me an idea of how cannibalization score is calculated in ScoutCannibalizationScore.py? Just make it simpler and easy to understand.

# Documentation Writing PDF
5. Prepare me a good descriptive non-technical business documentation to share with the client for all the modules inside "Exploratory Process" folder which should be in business terms and easily understandable to a non-technical person. Save the documentation as pdf file inside a new folder named Documentations with an apt name.


# Code Manipulation
6. Add docstrings and proper relevant line comments to the ScoutCombinedExp.py, ScoutCautionScoreExp.py modules using PEP257 Standards and save it.
